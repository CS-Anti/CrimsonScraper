# Repl.it-Scraper
So this scraper was initially made for pastebin but it sucked ass so i fized it so that it actually worked and then made it scrape Repl.it instead. You can make it scrape whatever coding site you want for whatever keyword you want and it is really easy to figure out how if you know Python3.
