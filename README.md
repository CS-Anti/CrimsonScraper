# Repl.it-Scraper
So this scraper was initially made by https://repl.it/@cielphantomhive for https://pastebin.com but it sucked ass so i fixed it so that it actually worked and then made it scrape repl.it instead of Pastebin because I wanted to find selfbots so that i could get their user tokens... i mean that was a type. So that i could get cool inspiration for future projects... You can make it scrape whatever site you want for whatever keyword you want and it is really easy to figure out if you know Python3.
